This repository contains the assignment projects for the Embedded Software Essentials Specialization by University of Colorado on Coursera

Only 2 courses out of 6 within the specialization are available for now and the future of the specialization is uncertain. Due to this reason only assignments within the first 2 courses will be present in this repository and Introduction to Embedded Systems Software and Development Environments final project is the only programming assignment within the specialization at the moment.
